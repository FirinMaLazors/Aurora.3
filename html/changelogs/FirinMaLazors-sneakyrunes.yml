changes: 
  - rscadd: "Changed cult welcome text to say tome, not talisman."
  - rscadd: "Recofigured atom/proc/examine to use an argument instead of istype to determine whether something should not show as "blood-stained".  Examine's children have been updated to use the argument correctly."
  - rscadd: "Changed check to see if something is "oil-stained" from #030303 to COLOR_OIL || COLOR_IPC_BLOOD."
  - rscadd: "Tomes and runes will not show as "blood-stained".
  - rscadd: "Copied and edited PDA-pen code to make the tome spawn with a piece of chalk the color of a nearby cultist's blood in it.  Drawing a cult rune changes the chalk's color to the last drawer's blood color, and bloodies it."
  - rscadd: "Drawing a rune requires having the engraved chalk the tome starts with in it.  Don't lose it."
  - rscadd: "Changes rune drawing text from cutting your hand with a random knife you never see to draw in blood, to magically imbuing a piece of chalk with your blood using spikes in the tome, then drawing with the chalk.  The finishing text includes a  mental prayer.  The spikes will be bloody if the tome has been used to draw a rune."
  - rscadd: "Changes rune drawing sound to newly added chalk sounds, since we're not using an invisible sacrifical knife anymore.

  - rscadd: "Changes crayon, chalk, and cult rune descriptions to be very similar."
  - rscadd: "Changes drafting chalk to just chalk; it can switch between line-drawing mode, which works as normal, and freestyle mode, which works like crayon drawing.  Drawing code copied from crayon code.  It has drawing sound, too; see attribution above."
  - rscadd: "Fixed crayon drawing code; it would keep a buffer of previously drawn crayon decals, and sometimes randomly use those instead of whatever you were actually trying to draw.  The intention was to avoid drawing the same thing twice in a row, I guess, but I'm not sure.  I just made the list empty itself after each use."
  - rscadd: "Fixes tome description to display the correct text to ghosts and cultists.  Tome description updated to mention the spikes, and make it unholy to cultists."
  - rscadd: "Fixed blood drips saying they're red, since they can be any species' color.  Bonus points for catching the reference."

changes: 
  - rscadd: "Changed cult welcome text to say tome, not talisman."
  - rscadd: "Changed cult runes to not be 'blood-stained!'."
  - rscadd: "Changes text to make the act of drawing a rune more non-obviously weird, more religious for its drawer, and makes looking in the tome more obviously weird."
  - rscadd: "Changes rune description to merely seem like it's drawn in something like blood, not outright stated to be drawn in blood."
